# Docs Intro

Let's discover **Spearmint in 5 minutes**.

Overview:
1. Register an app e.g. "Bob's NFTs"
2. Create an NFT Collection - not an NFT, an account from which to create NFTs
3. Create an NFT Series - 1/1, 1/1,000,000 it's up to you
4. Create Claim Links - these are used to "deliver" your NFTs to your users. Each claim link can create 1 wallet and claim 1 NFT from your series

Concepts:
- testnet is the NEAR testnet and our own testnet environment
- mainnet is currently restricted access

Work in Progress:
- themes for claim pages
- API docs
