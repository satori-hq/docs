# Introduction

### Let's discover Spearmint in 5 minutes!

#### Overview:
1. **Register and activate your unique Spearmint app** so that you can do all the great stuff below!
2. **Create an NFT Collection** - a NEAR account with a Smart Contract deployed to it!
3. **Create an NFT Series** - a template that can be used for a 1-of-1 NFT or a 1/1,000,000 NFT, as you wish!
4. **Create Claim Links** - these are used to "deliver" your NFTs to your users. Each claim link can create 1 wallet and claim 1 NFT from your series!

#### Concepts:
- **`testnet`** is the NEAR testnet network and Spearmint's own testnet environment
- **`mainnet`** is currently available only to approved users. We recommend that you play around on testnet, and contact us if you'd like to get access to mainnet!

#### Coming Soon:
- Full API Documentation! ðŸ¥³
